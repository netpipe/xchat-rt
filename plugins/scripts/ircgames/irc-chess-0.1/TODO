-increase parallelism when playing multiple games
-random invalid move errors with pawns (moving foreward???).
 these havent shown up in a while tho. perhaps i just tested
 wrong?
-add a display board function
-check for check-mate 
-add a thread to kick idle users after some specified timeout
-limit the number of games on the server, and the number
 of games a single user can play. Otherwise DoS'ing the server
 will be easy as pie.
