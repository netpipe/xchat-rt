# XQF -> XChat Script
# Version 0.71 (Released Jan 15, 2006) 
# Written by Douglas Bollinger (Doogman) <doug@sdf.lonestar.org>
#
# Special thanks to Ludwig Nussel for bugfixes and additional features and
# Marcus Garcia (NiTrO) for ideas and testing.  I would also like to thank
# Steffen Pankratz for bug fixes.
#
# More thanks to Gatewood Green (Woody) for Perl coding techniques for

#
# Based on the GameSpy -> mIrc Script by Peter Reinhold
#
# This script allows other IRC users to query for stats of a gameserver you
# are using by typing a command.  Requires XQF and XChat.
#
# Also included is optional Licq support.  When you start gaming, the
# script will set your ICQ status to a user-specified setting and update
# your autoresponse message with the stats of the game server you are
# currently using.  When you return from the game, your ICQ status will be
# set to available and your autoresponse message will be reset.
#
# NOTE: The Licq integration is no longer maintained, but you can enable it
# below.  If you have a patch to make Licq work better again, I would
# appreciate it.
#
# XQF is available at http://www.linuxgames.com/xqf/
# XChat is available at http://www.xchat.org
# Licq is available at http://www.licq.com
#
# The latest version of this script is available for download at the 
# XQF -> XChat homepage at http://doug.freeshell.org/xqf-xchat/
#
# Tested on Linux XChat 1.8.11, XQF 0.9.11.2 and Licq 1.0.3 
#
# To use, copy this script to ~/.xchat/ and enable LaunchInfo.txt support
# in XQF via preferences/appearance.

# Below is the setting to enable/disable server pinging.  Here's a typical
# use for this feature to describe it's function:  You and your friends
# meet in a IRC channel and decide to use a public server.  Someone uses
# XQF to find a nice server, uses copy or copy+ to grab the server info,
# types in xchat "!aping" (default, can be changed) and pastes the server
# information (the dotted quad IP address) after the command into a xchat
# window.  All the other xchat users who have this script running with the
# pingserver feature enabled will automatically ping the server and report
# the ping results back to that channel for the other users to see.  This
# way you can find a good server for all the people in the channel quickly
# and easily with a minimal amount of cut and pasting of IP numbers.
#
# Input examples:
# !aping 205.177.13.20
# !aping 205.177.13.20:27963
# !aping 66  205.177.13.20:27963   =JC= Just Cause  mp_assault  10 of 20
#
# Output example:
# 205.177.13.20= 64.219 ms
#
# Since this feature probably can be used for nefarious purposes, it is
# disabled by default; you can enable it below.  It is also recommended to
# use the active_channels feature to limit the script activity to just the
# channel(s) that you and your gaming buddies use for meetings.

$config{'pingserver'} = 0;	# Enable server pinging 
							# Set to 1 to enable, 0 to disable

# Below is the active channel setting.  Normally this script listens for
# commands and sends the join and notice/wall messages to every channel
# opened in the main Xchat window.  Sometimes you want to monitor channels
# while gaming whose participants aren't interested in your gaming
# information, so the active channels feature was added.  Any channels
# added to the active channels list will be the ONLY ones monitored for
# commands or to receive join or notice/wall messages.  Note:  Due to the
# nature of wall (write all), it will be completely disabled when using
# active channels.  If you want other chatters (in channels not in the
# active channel list) to be notified when you start or return from a game,
# you must activate notice and/or notice_return.  These are set off by
# default.
# 
# Please note that if you activate the "away" setting that people in
# channels other than the active channel list will see a message.  This is
# a feature of IRC.
#
# Put your active channels inbetween the parenthesis, with a single space
# between the channels and each channel starting with a pound (#) sign.
# Add as many channels as you like.  If no active channels are entered,
# _ALL_ channels will be monitored for commands and receive script output,
# which is the default setting.
# 
# Example:
# @active_channels = qw(#clanxqf #myotherclan);
