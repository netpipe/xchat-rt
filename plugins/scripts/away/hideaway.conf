# This is a config file for X-Away (and Weevil's MP3 script)
# It tells the scripts not to show global messages in certain
# channels on certain IRC servers.
# syntax:
# serverRegexp = #chan1regexp #chan2regexp #chan3regexp #chan4regexp

# This takes effect on all networks:
.* = #wehateglobals #wehatespam #wehateamsgs

# this takes effect on channels that begin with noaway or nomsg on all nets.
# note that for channel regexps, a leading ^ (match from start of line) is
# automatically prepended.
.* = #noaway.* #nomsg.*

# override flags:
# put a v before the channel # (or + or &) if you want your away messages to show
# up if you're voiced there. Put an o if you want your away messages to show if
# you're opped there. put both if you want them to show if you're voiced OR opped.

# This is the same as above:
.* = #(noaway|nomsg)

# This takes effect on undernet
undernet\.org$ = #cservice

# you get the idea...
