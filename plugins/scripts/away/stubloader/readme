Weevil's StubLoader 1.0
-----------------------

This makes handling your Xchat scripts a little less painful.

Place stubloader.pl in your Xchat data directory, and create a file called
stubloader.conf in that directory.

In stubloader.conf you can put a list of files (or directories) that you want
to be loaded in Xchat.

If you specify one or more directories in the conf file they will be scanned
for .pl scripts (recursively). If the script finds two scripts with the same
name, only the first one it found will be loaded.

It is hardcoded not to load stubloader.pl if it encounters it during a scan,
so don't rename it!

The main purpose of Stubloader is to allow you to load scripts that aren't
in xchat's data directory automatically when xchat starts (otherwise you'd
have to /LOAD them all manually) and also load whole bunches of scripts by
recursively parsing directory trees.

Note: Don't put a / on its own line in the config, or it'll parse your whole
disk, loading every .pl file it finds.
