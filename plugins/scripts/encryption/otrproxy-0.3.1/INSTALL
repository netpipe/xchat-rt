REQUIREMENTS

To compile the OTR proxy, you'll need at least:
 - libgpg-error 1.0  [ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgpg-error/]
 - libgcrypt 1.2.0   [ftp://ftp.gnupg.org/gcrypt/libgcrypt/]
 - libotr 2.0.1      [http://www.cypherpunks.ca/otr/]
 - wxWidgets 2.5.x   [http://www.wxwidgets.org/]

If you install these with a package manager, you'll probably need the
-dev or -devel versions of the packages.

COMPILING

If you're got a CVS copy, you will need to regenerate the configure
script using:

    autoreconf -s -i

Once you have the configure script (which comes with the source
deistribution), run it with any options that may be necessary for your
system.  Some examples:

Linux:
    ./configure --prefix=/usr --mandir=/usr/share/man

NETBSD:
    CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/pkg/include" LDFLAGS="-R/usr/pkg/lib -L/usr/pkg/lib" \
	./configure --prefix=/usr/pkg

mingw cross-compiler from Debian Linux:
    ./configure --build=`./config.guess` --host=i586-mingw32msvc  \
	--prefix=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc \
	--with-wx-config=/usr/i586-mingw32msvc/bin/wx-config


Once the configure script writes a Makefile, you should be able to just
run "make".

INSTALLATION

You should be able to simply do "make install".  If you want to install
somewhere other than / (this is useful for package creators), use
something like "make DESTDIR=/path/to/install/to install".
