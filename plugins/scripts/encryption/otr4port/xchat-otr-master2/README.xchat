The README  file is written  for irssi but what's  said there mostly  applies to
xchat  as  well. The  only  difference  is  that  xchat doesn't  support  adding
/settings, so in order to see and change the current settings you'll have to use
the "/otr set" command. Without arguments  it will show the current settings and
if supplied with  a setting name and  a value it will change  the given setting.
There is no  persistence, i.e. each time you start  xchat the hardcoded defaults
will be active. Please use standard xchat scripting magic to change the defaults
to your liking on startup. It seems overkill to have a config parser/writer just
for this plugin and it is fortunately not neccessary.
