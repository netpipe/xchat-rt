FISH v0.98 for XChat [History]
******************************



15.03.2006:	v0.98
		- encrypted outgoing messages are now truncated to 512
		  chars, avoiding problems with IRC servers like Undernet

		- FiSH is now multithreaded, hopefully :)

		- problems with psyBNC log decryption using different
		  networks solved

		- problems with 'hilight' partially solved (new feature
		  in blow.ini: 'no_formatting=1')

		- new command: /encrypt [< 1/y/on | 0/n/off >]
                  enable or disable FiSH encryption

		- new command: /decrypt [< 1/y/on | 0/n/off >]
                  enable or disable FiSH decryption

		- Local channels (using '&' instead of '#') are now
		  supported

		- using '/dev/urandom' in DH1080.c now, this solves
		  crash/freeze problems with DH1080 key-exchange
		  (reported by rho; thanx for the help, flier)

		- Get/WritePrivateProfileString completely rewritten,
		  fixing an evil crash on some systems and problems
		  with screwed up blow.ini if you run out of disc space
		  (reported by daxxar and k9)

		- x86_64 compatible now! (thanx kvatn and Ptah for helping)

		- improved makefile: just run 'make'

		- more internal changes and fixes



27.07.2004:	v0.97a
		- new feature: 'NickTracker' will allow seamless
		  conversations in the case your chat partner suddenly
		  changes his nick. If enabled this feature will simply
		  copy the old key to use with his new nick.

		- also added a feature called "mark broken block"
		  which will indicate whether a broken block was cut,
		  meaning the message arrived incomplete from server



07.06.2004:	v0.97
		- topic encryption is now supported... but keep in
		  mind: topic size SHRINKS drastically to about 60%!
		  This is already insufficient for a common eBay URL
		  syntax: /topic+ <your topic>

		- notice encryption is now supported
		  syntax: /notice+ <nick/#channel> <your notice>

		- new command: /msg+ (send encrypted message)
		  syntax: /msg+ <nick/#channel> <your message>

		- new command: /unsetinipw
		  Change back to default blow.ini password

		- block-align base64 strings if truncated by IRC
		  server: no more broken blocks at the end of long
		  messages!



30.04.2004:	v0.96
		- first release
