This include file is provided here for convenience's sake, so people don't have
to download the entire X-Chat source tree if their distribution's X-Chat package
doesn't provide it.

This should be okay as xchat-plugin.h doesn't seem to change much from one
release of xchat2 to the next, and the author suggests including the file in
plugins distributions anyway.
