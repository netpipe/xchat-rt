Description: X-Chat morse plugin
 CWirc is a plugin for the X-Chat IRC client to transmit raw morse code over
 the internet using IRC servers as reflectors. The transmitted morse code can
 be received in near real-time by other X-Chat clients with the CWirc plugin.
 CWirc tries to emulate a standard amateur radio rig : it sends and receives
 morse over virtual channels, and it can listen to multiple senders transmitting
 on the same channel. Morse code is keyed locally using a straight or iambic
 key connected to a serial port, or using the mouse buttons, and the sound is
 played through the soundcard.
