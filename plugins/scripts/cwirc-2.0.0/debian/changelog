cwirc (2.0.0-0) unstable; urgency=low
  * Added an entry to disable the decoder

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@skynet.be>  Sat, 20 May 2006 23:37:00 +0200

cwirc (1.8.8-0) unstable; urgency=low
  * Corrected a bug in the incoming signal buffering that would overwrite
    buffered events when frames would come too fast during the fade-out period,
    just after a buffer underrun.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Thu, 05 Aug 2004 01:27:00 +0200

cwirc (1.8.7-0) unstable; urgency=low
  * Added a section in the README to explain how to use CWirc with the aRts
    daemon. The DTR line is now explicitely set so that CWirc can read back
    the state of the Morse key contact(s), even if another program left the
    serial port in a bad state.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Sun, 25 Jul 2004 18:30:00 +0200

cwirc (1.8.6-0) unstable; urgency=low
  * Made the plugin stub filter out CWirc frames even when the plugin is
    disabled, so it's now possible to close the CWirc panel and keep chatting
    normally on a Morse channel. Made the plugin stub correctly handle channel
    locks on different IRC servers, and made it warn the user when a lock is
    stale.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Mon, 19 Jul 2004 02:52:00 +0200

cwirc (1.8.5-0) unstable; urgency=low
  * Corrected the README and added a French translation of it. Added the -fPIC
    flag to build the plugin's object files. Changed the Debian package
    maintainer and merged his changes.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Thu, 08 Jul 2004 23:03:00 +0200

cwirc (1.8.4-1.0.0.1.pure64) unstable; urgency=low

  * Build extra shared objects with -fPIC for the plugin

 -- Goswin von Brederlow <brederlo@informatik.uni-tuebingen.de>  Thu,  8 Jul 2004 19:04:02 +0200

cwirc (1.8.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Initial debian release.

 -- Joop Stakenborg <pa3aba@debian.org>  Sat,  3 Jul 2004 09:16:02 +0200

cwirc (1.8.4-0) unstable; urgency=low
  * Corrected a bug that would leave the I/O process running alone if the GUI
    quit without stopping it properly. Made the extension API's shared memory
    key really random. CWirc now tries to renice itself if the frontend binary
    is installed suid root, in order to get better I/O performances and cure
    the scratchy sound problem with low-end sound devices and loaded systems.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Sun, 20 Jun 2004 19:03:00 +0200

cwirc (1.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Made the sound fragment writing routine less fragile. Doubled the automatic
    decoder's speed indicator as a decoder reset button. Fixed a bug where the
    CWirc front-end would stop if X-Chat was started from an xterm and the
    terminal was resized.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Fri, 18 Jun 2004 03:21:00 +0200

cwirc (1.8.2-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Reduced the memory and disk footprint. General code cleanup. Made the keyer
    settings tab become inactive when the selected key type is "straight".
    Changed all references to "QRM" into the correct "QRN". Fixed a GTK error
    message when starting the GUI. Fixed a bug that could prevent an extension
    to be run again if it failed to run once.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Sun, 13 Jun 2004 23:55:08 +0200

cwirc (1.8.1-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Now the plugin doesn't report incoming morse from any source but the
    current IRC channel, on the current CWirc channel. Fixed a bug that would
    make CWirc occasionally send malformed frames containing null events when
    running with the CW output set to "sounder".

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Tue, 13 Apr 2004 01:50:08 +0200

cwirc (1.8.0-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Re-implemented the keyer, with a full set of options. The frontend now
    checks its version number against the plugin's, to avoid using an
    incompatible shared memory structure.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Thu, 01 Apr 2004 00:09:20 +0200

cwirc (1.7.7-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Added "About" tab to give general information about CWirc. Made the cwirc
    window non-resizable. Added two new keyer modes besides mode-A and mode-B :
    a dit memory mode and a dit+dah memory mode.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Fri, 26 Mar 2004 02:35:00 +0200

cwirc (1.7.6-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * An undecoded character is now indicated by an underscore in the morse
    decoder line, and not a question mark, so it's more readable and less
    confusing. Corrected the '8' sign in the DOT code table and removed the
    E-circumflex sign from the French morse code table because it conflicted
    with the slash sign.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Tue, 23 Mar 2004 00:39:00 +0200

cwirc (1.7.5-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Added a sidetone mode, to key Morse code locally without actually sending
    anything. This is good to adjust keys and generally play without bothering
    anyone else, exactly like the equivalent function found on most real
    transceivers. Now the Morse decoder also decodes the local key. Implemented
    the new ITU "commat" Morse sign ('@' sign, as in emails) and corrected the
    'VA' prosign in the Morse code table.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Fri, 20 Feb 2004 02:57:00 +0200

cwirc (1.7.4-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Corrected a bug that spawned an infinity of error popups if writing to the
    sound device generated an error despite the sound device having been opened
    and set up successfully.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Tue, 27 Jan 2004 02:29:40 +0200

cwirc (1.7.3-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Added rules to create a binary and source RPMs.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Wed, 14 Jan 2004 01:38:22 +0200

cwirc (1.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=low
  * Added DOT code support in the automatic decoder. Made replying to CTCP
    queries and returning the current channel number the default behaviour.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Tue, 06 Jan 2004 02:40:00 +0200

cwirc (1.7.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The accuracy of sent and received timing events has been improved
    dramatically. A bad data corruption bug in the frame sending routine has
    been corrected.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Mon, 10 Oct 2003 03:19:00 +0200

cwirc (1.7.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added a CWirc extension interface. Made the ipc routines more generic.
    Corrected the sound mixing to implement volume and squelch properly.
    Implemented an extension to the existing frame format to allow high-speed
    Morse to pass through IRC within the flood limits imposed by IRC servers.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Sun, 09 Oct 2003 00:12:40 +0200

cwirc (1.6.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * The channel lock is now reset when the plugin is re-enabled. Modified the
    Makefile to build CWirc on NetBSD.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Tue, 28 Oct 2003 22:22:05 +0200

cwirc (1.6.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added French Morse code in the automatic Morse decoder. Added IRC channel
    locking and unlocking commands (/CWLOCK and /CWUNLOCK). Reorganized the
    main panel so the presentation of the preset channels is more logical.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Sat, 18 Oct 2003 04:34:43 +0200

cwirc (1.5.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added 5 preset CW channels, instead of just one adjustment. Added the
    X-Chat "xchat-plugin.h" include file in the CWirc distribution, so it's
    not necessary to download the entire X-Chat source tree if the file isn't
    provided by the distribution. Modified the Makefile and #ifdef'ed bits of
    the source code to build CWirc for FreeBSD cleanly and without patch.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Wed, 15 Oct 2003 03:15:05 +0200

cwirc (1.4.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Changed key_t types to int, removed Linux-only and Intel-only signals,
    added missing #include in plugin.c, changed #include <linux/soundcard> to
    #include <sys/soundcard.h> in io.c and modified the Makefile to facilitate
    the port of CWirc to FreeBSD. Added a patch and instructions to build CWirc
    on FreeBSD.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Thu, 02 Oct 2003 00:00:00 +0200

cwirc (1.4.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Corrected a minor bug in the morse frame validity testing.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Wed, 01 Oct 2003 01:40:00 +0200

cwirc (1.4.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added Russian and Japanese morse in the automatic CW decoder. Corrected a
    bug in the decoder's buffer scrolling. Made the front-end wait a bit before
    quitting on an error to allow the plugin portion to catch the error message.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Fri, 26 Sep 2003 19:05:00 +0200

cwirc (1.3.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the QRM louder and corrected its implementation. Corrected the QRM
    mixing. Corrected a bug in the GUI where the callsign text entry would
    always be disabled at startup. Made the squelch more sensitive.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Tue, 09 Sep 2003 01:20:00 +0200

cwirc (1.3.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added adjustable QRM simulation. Added signal strength and sporadic-E
    propagation simulation, based on the physical distance between operators,
    calculated from advertised grid square locations of the operators.
    Extended the CW frame protocol to pass grid square locations. Added optional
    grid square location in the GUI. Added optional grid square reporting in
    the CTCP CWIRC query. Added a squelch in the main panel. Corrected the
    sound mixing to match that of a real ham radio. Added soft incoming signal
    fadeout. Moved the creation of outgoing CW frames back to cwframe.c where it
    belongs. Many minor corrections.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Sat, 06 Sep 2003 03:29:42 +0200

cwirc (1.2.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Improved the accuracy of the Morse decoder.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Sat, 30 Aug 2003 02:54:55 +0200

cwirc (1.2.2-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the plugin answer channel-wide CTCP CWIRC queries. CW frames sent as
    notices are now decoded and played.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Thu, 28 Aug 2003 05:09:18 +0200

cwirc (1.2.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the decoder line frame stick to the decoder line. Improved the sound
    quality when mixing several CW sound sources. Simplified the S-meter and
    morse key icon drawing routines, and modified the CW beep generator, to be
    more CPU-friendly on slower machines. Fixed the dependency against X-Chat
    in the debian binary package. Added "CWirc" button in the userlist buttons.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Sat, 24 Aug 2003 13:41:05 +0200

cwirc (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added the ability to play morse code as sounder clicks. Regular morse beeps
    are now smoother.  Changed the "FINE" setting into "RX pitch", and added
    "TX pitch" and "Volume" controls in the main panel. Made the mouse keying
    zone show either a straight key or an iambic key according to the keying
    mode it is emulating. Added a received morse speed indicator in the
    automatic decoder line. Slightly corrected the automatic keyer WPM timing.
    Made the automatic decoder more resilient to temporary variations of the
    received morse speed.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Sat, 16 Aug 2003 00:24:41 +0200

cwirc (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Extended the frame format to include an explicit callsign. Added optional
    custom CTCP query. Added a page in the GUI to change the callsign, control
    whether it's sent in the morse frames or not, and CTCP query replies.
    Reviewed all the strcpy() and strncpy() calls in the code. Made the
    semaphore/shared memory IDs random.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Sat, 09 Aug 2003 19:03:23 +0200

cwirc (1.0.1-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Made the main GUI window tabbed. Made various parts of the GUI go gray when
    they become irrelevant.

 -- Pierre-Philippe Coupard <pcoupard@easyconnect.fr>  Tue, 07 Aug 2003 21:42:13 +0200

cwirc (1.0.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Split CWirc into a X-Chat plugin stub and a executable front-end called by
    the plugin. Replaced the X11 user interface with a full-featured GTK+ gui.
    Added automatic configuration file creation and saving. Made the receive
    buffering adjustable. Made opening the sound device non-blocking. Added
    uninstall target in the Makefile. Fixed many small bugs.
