Cancel's GoogleBot

History:
The original BibleBot 1.0 was written in Perl.  I learned Perl specifically to write the first bot only because there wasn't one in existance.  I was very green as Perl was my first stab at programming.  The code will probably show this if you look at it. After it was said and done though the thing worked.  I also went on to write companion GoogleBot, DictBot, SeenBot, OpBot, & WeatherBot.

The bot may be used locally or remotely.  For uses in the channel syntax is as follows:

!google phrase
!spell word or phrase

For local usage 

/google query word or phrase
/google spell word or phrase

pygoogle must be installed by untarring and doing python setup.py install
googlebot.ini and googlebot.py MUST GO IN YOUR ~/.xchat2

Explanation of the lines in the ini file.

One of the seemingly inconsequential but biggest changes in my scripts is taking the variables out of the script an putting them all in their own file.  It doesn't matter what order they are in in the file just that they are there.  One option per line.

This option tells the bot if it should service others.  Local usage is always on.
service = True

This option is your google api key obtained from http://www.google.com/api
licensekey = yourkeygoeshere

This option is how many replies go back to a public channel request
publiclimit = 3

This options is how many replies go back to a private message request
privatelimit = 5

This option is how many replies go back to a channel from a local request
locallimit = 8

This option turns off or on the safesearch field of the google api request
safesearch = 1

This option says wether you should say your results in the channel tab you're onor in a seperate window.  If you are using it as a bot for a channel set to False.
returnintab = True
