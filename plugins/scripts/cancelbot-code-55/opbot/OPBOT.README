Cancel's OpBot 

History:
The original BibleBot 1.0 was written in Perl.  I learned Perl specifically to write the first bot only because there wasn't one in existence.  I was very green as Perl was my first stab at programming.  The code will probably show this if you look at it. after it was said and done though the thing worked.  I also went on to write companion GoogleBot, DictBot, SeenBot, OpBot, & WeatherBot.

I can't remember why but one day I decided to learn Python.  Rather then fix all of the things I  could have done better in my perl scripts and so I could get some practice in my new language I decided to rewrite all my scripts in Python.  It was rough going at first but now I must confess I love the cleaner look and the true object orientation.  I also really started to dig the fact that each python script ran in its own interpretor and I could access the Python console while in Xchat for testing.

opbot.ini and opbot.py MUST GO IN YOUR .xchat2/

Explanation of the lines in the ini file.

One of the seemingly inconsequential but biggest changes in my scripts is taking the variables out of the script an putting them all in their own file.  It doesn't matter what order they are in in the file just that they are there and in the right section.
NONE OF THE OPTIONS SHOULD BE BLANK
